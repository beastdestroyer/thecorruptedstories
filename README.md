# The Corrupted Stories
In my spare time, for quite a while actually (6 months), I've been working on a few short stories. These stories are all part of the same plot, and their group name is: The Corrupted Stories.

I've been inspired by many elements that i've compounded together with my imagination (whatever there is left of it) to produce stuff which I think are pretty exciting, despite me not really interested in being a full-time author or anything. Below are the elements and sources which have been a great source of inspiration for these stories

- The ['Five Nights at Freddy's'](https://scottgames.com) series by Scott Cawthon: It's deep story and lore has made me want to include some of my own
- [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://ddlc.moe) by [Team Salvato](https://teamsalvato.com): Similarly to FNAF, it's deep lore but also skewed view of the world, has wanted me to take that for a ride.
- Robert Louis Stevenson's _The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_: The ambiguity and negative atmosphere is prevalent through my stories - I studied this in English too!
- Japan: Yes, I barely watch anime or know much about Japanese culture, but the names of the characters are inspired (koff, nicked) from there.
- Add other sources which I forgot

I would also like to say that since I have been doing small amounts (not everyday either) that I have no ETA on completion. They will be updated as I go along.

## Contribution

I will NOT be accepting any requests or issues for story ideas or whatnot, though I will compound them and make another set of stories? Who knows.

I'm not a perfect human being, so I will probably make errors, typos or inconsistencies, despite me using Microsoft Word. I will only be accepting requests for fixes relating to:
- Grammatical issues
- Punctuation issues
- Spelling issues

All others will probably be denied.

If you've made it down here, wow, thank you very much and feel free to read, distribute etc. these stories under the given license.
