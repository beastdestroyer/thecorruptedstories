# The Corrupted Stories
In my spare time, for quite a while actually (6 months), I've been working on a few short stories. These stories are all part of the same plot, and theior group name is: The Corrupted Stories.

I've been inspired by many elements that i've compounded together with my imagination (whatever there is left of it) to produce stuff which I think are pretty exciting, despite me not really interested in being a full-time author or anything. Below are the elements and sources which have been a great source of inspiration for these stories

- The ['Five Nights at Freddy's'](https://scottgames.com) series by Scott Cawthon: It's deep story and lore has made me want to include some of my own
- [Doki Doki Literature Club](https://ddlc.moe) by [Team Salvato](https://teamsalvato.com): Similarly to FNAF, it's deep lore but also skewed view of the world, has wanted me to take that for a ride.
- Robert Louis Stevenson's _The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde_: The ambiguity and negative atmosphere is prevalent through my stories - I study this in English too!
- Japan: Yes, I barely watch anime or catch up on japanese culture, but the names of the characters are taken from there, and some terminology too.

I would also like to say that since I have been doing small amounts (not everyday either) that I have no ETA on completion. They will be updated as I go along.

## Contribution

I will NOT be accepting any requests or issues for story ideas or whatnot, though I will compound them and make another set of stories? Who knows.

I'm not a perfect human being, so I will probably make errors, typos or inconsistencies, despite me using Microsoft Word. I will only be accepting requests for fixes relating to:
- Grammatical issues
- Punctuation issues
- Spelling issues

All others will be denied.

If you've made it down here, wow, thank you very much and feel free to read these stories.
