        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In my spare time, for quite a while actually, I've been working on a
          few short stories. These stories are all part of the same plot, and
          their group name is: The Corrupted Stories/Series.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been inspired by many elements that i've compounded together with
          my imagination (whatever there is left of it) to produce stuff which I
          think are pretty exciting, despite me not really interested in being a
          full-time author or anything. Below are the elements and sources which
          have been a great source of inspiration for these stories.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The
            <a href="https://scottgames.com">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> series
            by Scott Cawthon: It has deep story and lore which has was a core
            inspiration for the stories, and something I wanted to experiment
            with.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://ddlc.moe">Doki Doki Literature Club</a> by
            <a href="https://teamsalvato.com">Team Salvato</a> Similarly to
            FNAF, it's deep lore but also skewed view of the world, has wanted
            me to take that for a ride.
          </li>
          <li>
            Robert Louis Stevenson's
            <span class="italic">The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</span
            >: The ambiguity and negative atmosphere is prevalent through my
            stories - I studied this in English too!
          </li>
          <li>
            Japan: Yes, I barely watch anime or know much about Japanese
            culture, but the names of the characters are inspired (koff, nicked)
            from there
          </li>
          <li>Add other sources which I forgot</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I would also like to say that since I have been doing small amounts
          (not everyday either) that I have no ETA on completion. They will be
          updated as I go along.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          I will consider any suggestions for these sets of stories and seeing
          where they could all go if I were to fit them in. As my goal is to
          manipulate lore and ambiguity, the suggestions must be crazy!
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not a perfect human being, so I will probably make errors, typos
          or inconsistencies, despite me using Microsoft Word. I will only be
          accepting requests for fixes relating to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Grammatical issues</li>
          <li>Punctuation issues</li>
          <li>Spelling issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many others will most likely be denied, but there will be
          consideration and perhaps they may be used for a future project?
        </p>
