          Normal lives turn grim, as the results of an unexpected event trash
          the world in ways deemed unimaginable. Itsuzaki Yoshino, your average
          high-schooler; your average go-to perv Fugayaka Tomoya; the expressive
          but mature Nimiro Tatsumi, and the silent but nerdy Syenshi Kotomi are
          all trapped amidst the chaos. As the world around them crumbles, who
          will rise up and destroy this Corrupted Reality? And who will fall in
          doing so?

          <span class="italic">Click, click</span> went the mouse as Yoshino
          briskly clicked on various links from Google to complete his flipping
          science homework for tomorrow. It was that time of night when you
          realize you’ve forgotten about school life, and have to catch up once
          you zoom back into reality.
        </p>

        <p>22:32. 1 hour, 28 Minutes left…</p>

        <p>
          <span class="italic">bzzz bzzz</span> went his phone; “Who da hell is
          messaging me at this time of night?” he muttered, realizing again that
          he’s awake at this time of night. (Ironic, huh?) But instead,it was
          from an unknown number, and the message read:
        </p>

        <p class="of">
          “V2hhdCB0aGlzIG1lc3NhZ2UgY29udGFpbnMgaXMgdGhlIFNvbHV0aW9uLiBBY2NlcHQgb3IgRGVjbGluZS4=”
        </p>

        <p>
          “What kind of dummy stranger decides to do this...” and deletes the
          message, only suddenly being greeted by 100 more of the same. “Fucking
          hell...” Hastily ignoring it and turning to face his screen again, he
          noticed that a bright, square post-it note had been stuck on the
          screen. “How the f…”, he wondered, before ripping it off and skimming
          over it. The note was of average type: yellow, small, you know - the
          usual, but the handwriting however…. was absolutely ASTOUNDING!!
          Yoshino analysed more at how consistent and beautiful the letters
          were, rather than focusing on the actual message. It looked like he
          was going to have rainbows shooting everywhere.
          <span class="st"
            >(Kinda odd for that to happen huh? Let’s stick to realism here as
            much as possible, after all, this is the Corrupted Reality).</span
          >
          After 10 fine minutes of admiration, he finally read it: ‘She who has
          the power to corrupt, shall be the maiden of your dreams; From R’;
          “Who’s ‘R’?”. He questioned further, before he realized he had
          homework, and simply put it down, returning to work.
        </p>
        <p>“Ugh, finally…”</p>
        <p>22:58. 1 hour, 2 minutes.</p>

        <p>
          Plopping down to bed, he quickly reached REM mode
          <span class="st"
            >(for all you dummies I’m talking to, it’s called Rapid Eye
            Movement, and is the deepest part of your sleep; it usually occurs
            1- 2 hours after you actually start sleeping, and is when your brain
            is very active. Sleep well, all…)</span
          >
          and eventually snored. A lot.
        </p>

        <p>“Yoshino... Yoshino...”.</p>

        <p>
          He woke up. In a dream. “Wh…,”, he stuttered, “Where… a... am. I?”.
        </p>

        <p>White hair. Reddish-cherry eyes. Wearing his school uniform.</p>

        <p>
          “I’m coming to get you: you’re mine for the taking.”. She smiled and
          tilted her head 45 degrees to her left
          <span class="st">(our right if there was a picture here).</span> The
          dream flickered out, and all he saw was darkness… for a long time
        </p>

        <p>23:48. 12 Minutes.</p>

        <p>
          “<span class="italic">gasp gasp.</span>" He wheezed as he breathed
          violently. Snatching his clock from the grip of the table, he saw
          23:49 on the clock. “Aww fuck man….”. He panned his room. Window.
          Wall. Computer and Desk. Wall. Wardrobe. Open Door. Dra… “Open
          Door?!?!”. “WHO’S THERE?” he shouted, echoing the noise throughout his
          miserable little house.
        </p>

        <p>
          "<span class="italic">heehee</span>." A girl’s laugh responded to his
          shout. Then, she came in like a wrecking ball
          <span class="st">(I am so sorry….)</span> and lunged, like a tiger at
          his prey, at him.
        </p>

        <p>
          “AHHHHH”. He swung upright. Daylight. 08:09. “Shit! I’m going to be
          late at this rate!!”. He zoomed out of bed and headed straight for his
          bathroom. Brushing his teeth and peeing at the same time saved him 5
          minutes. 08:14. He went to create a sandwich with butter, cheddar
          cheese, ham and of course, some barbecue sauce
          <span class="st">(no ketchup… I swear I apologize).</span> Like a
          gorilla, he gobbled it down. This took 10 minutes: 08:24. Rushing to
          pack his lunch for school, he crammed 4 small but filling items: a
          Galaxy bar, packets of crisps, an apple and a drink into his
          schoolbag; got changed into his uniform and ran out of his home.
          <span class="italic">Keys jangling. Lock turning.</span> Breathless,
          he sped like a marathon runner, towards school.
        </p>
        <p>**</p>
        <p>The hustling of students at the school gate meant he wasn’t late, and he was actually relieved as he brought his homework too. <span class="st">(What a surprise that is, right?)</span> He trotted nonchalantly to his class as if nothing ever happened <span class="st">(Nothing really did to be honest)</span> and sat down at his desk. The usual spot for a lone teenager: back right of the classroom from the teacher’s perspective, next to the windows. He always sat next to the windows. Already, the focus switch had been killed, but that girl, that white hair, those cherry-red eyes looped and looped over and over again. His mind was a vicious washing machine. “ITSUZAKI-SANNNNN !!!!”. A swift but extremely blurred figure could be seen colliding with Yoshino, from another’s perspective, the final product was a giant bruise and a disfigured person on the floor. “Ack... What’s your prob dude?” “groans”. Tomoya is your average perv; no matter how you look at it, it was either him or some other boy flirting with the cute girls of the school.  He and Yoshino have been great friends since childhood and neither of them fail to piss each other off, or make each other laugh. “H... hi Itsuzaki-san” stuttered Kotomi as she walked in. The classroom felt silent, everyone stared at her, she darted behind Yoshino’s back like a mouse on the run. “What you all looking at?!?” raged Yoshino, and everyone went back to talking. Nervously. She blushes behind his back before stepping back a bit.</p>
